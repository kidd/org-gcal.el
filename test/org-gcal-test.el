;;; TODO: Figure out mocking for POST/PATCH followed by GET
;;; - ‘mock‘ might work for this - the argument list must be specified up
;;;   front, but the wildcard ‘*’ can be used to match any value. If that
;;;   doesn’t work, use ‘cl-flet’.

;;; TODO: Figure out how to set up org-id for mocking (org-mode tests should help?)
;;; - There are actually no org-mode tests for this.
;;; - Set ‘org-id-locations’ (a hash table). This maps each ID to the file in
;;;   which the ID is found, so a temp file (not just a temp buffer) is needed.
